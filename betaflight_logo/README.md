# Custom Betaflight startup logos

Use Font manager in Betaflight Configurator in the OSD tab to upload custom logo.

Note: Connect battery to power up OSD. USB power will probably not be enough.

## Image restrictions

* image has to be exactly 288px√ó72px
* the best to use PNG or BMP format
* background must be full green (#00ff00)
* must use white and black colors only
* green areas will be transparent on the OSD

## Tools

I don't usually work with graphic software and I don't wan't to install anything - I managed to create some of those logos by using only online tools:

* https://www.photo-kako.com/en/shade.cgi - Will convert image to strictly black and white, no shading.
* https://www.photopea.com/ - Great free online image editor.
